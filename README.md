IT-Forum-App
============

The Cordova crossplatform app for IT-Forum.

This includes the Android project but not iOS (Cordova version not compatible with the Xcode version we use).

Top folder might need to be renamed itforum, instead of IT-Forum-App (Bug when using with Visual Studio)


TODO
============
Database still unstable. 
While able to add participants in OS Browser by deleting any local copy of the WebSQL databasse, on Android adding favorite participants is not working at all.
This results in a relative emtpy page when clicking on "Networking"
